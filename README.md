#  KFUPM Roommate Finder

KFUPM Roommate Finder is a web application designed to help KFUPM students find compatible roommates efficiently and securely.
Instead of relying on random social media or WhatsApp groups, this platform allows students to filter search results based on preferences, communicate directly within the website, and use portal integration for authentication.
The app solves key issues such as lack of organized roommate matching, limited information sharing, and time-consuming manual searches.
This solution benefits both students and the university by making the roommate arrangement process smoother, faster, and more reliable.
